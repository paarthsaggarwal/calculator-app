# calculator app on android

I developed a calculator app by using Kivy and created an .apk file which could be installed on any android device.

# Inspiration
Followed the tutorial from: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqWLaMtDCyk&list=WL&index=1&ab_channel=GAURAVKUMARJAIN

And: https://realpython.com/mobile-app-kivy-python/#installing-kivy

# key things to consider
1. Create it in a google colab environment
2. Update the code filename as 'main.py'
3. Update .spec file with version number of Kivy, Kivymd and Pillow as shown below.
requirements = python3,kivy==2.0.0,kivymd,pillow
